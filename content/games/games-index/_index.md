# One-Page Games

[Be the Media](https://kidminotaur.com/games/one-page/be-the-media/): A role playing game about documentary filmmakers trying to right wrongs in their communities. The main file is three pages. The first page is a character sheet and all the rules on one page. It's all you need. There's also a GM reference sheet with rules and space to write notes instead of a character sheet, and a final page with credits, story seeds, and links to additional references. There's also a character keeper for online play.

# Apocalypse World stuff
