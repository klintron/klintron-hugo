Destiny City is the most populous city in the Pacific Northwestern United States. With a population of 1,199,450, it&#8217;s the 9th largest city in the United States and the third largest on the west coast.

Destiny City started as a small logging settlement and grew rapidly after many Chinese people settled there after the [anti-Chinese riots of 1885][1] and quickly grew into a flourishing port city. It has long been a hub for experimental technology companies, playing host to the early days of the aerospace industry in the early 20th century and attracting the founders of many pharmaceutical and information technology startups in more recent decades. Today it&#8217;s home to Yuanfen Aerospace, one of the oldest and largest aerospace companies, and WitchTel, the world&#8217;s largest software company.

Unfortunately, Destiny City&#8217;s laissez-faire attitude towards industry left the city badly polluted. The Environmental Protection Agency estimates its riverfront industrial district has more superfund sites per square mile than any other major west coast city. Nonetheless, real estate developers are hard at work restoring these brownfields in order to build housing to meet the demands of the booming population.

The city is hemmed in by the snaking Vancouver River. The infamous squatter settlement known as the Dignity Tower lies to the south of the river.
