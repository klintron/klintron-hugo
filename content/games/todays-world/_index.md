Drug dealers [smuggle contraband into prisons with drones][1]. You can pay back alley body-modders to install [microchips in your hands with cryptographic currency][2]. Powerful corporations [track your every move][3], while vast government surveillance systems [scan your emails][4]. Militaries wage cyberwarfare across the globe. [Cult leaders have the ear of world leaders][5]. A [washed up game show host][6] is now the President of the United States.

This isn&#8217;t some dystopian cyberpunk future. It&#8217;s _Today&#8217;s World_.

Today&#8217;s World is a rule-lite role playing game about the strangeness of modern life. It&#8217;s suitable for telling many stories in contemporary settings, from exploring complex social issues to wallowing in the absurdity of the human condition. Inspirations range from literary sources like William Gibson&#8217;s &#8220;Blue Ant&#8221; trilogy to pulpy entertainment like the Gotham TV series to more gonzo sources like Nathan Barley and Crank. Don&#8217;t worry if you&#8217;ve never heard of any of these things: the fact that you&#8217;re alive and breathing means you&#8217;re already living in Today&#8217;s World.

**You can down the playtest version [here][7] for free.** If you play it, please drop me a line at me@klintfinley.com and let me know how it goes!

The playtest rules assume the GM has some knowledge of _[Apocalypse World][8]_ or other games based on its rules, such as _[Urban Shadows][9]_, _[The Sprawl][10]_, or any other &#8220;Powered by the Apocalypse Game.&#8221; The final version will be a standalone, but for now it&#8217;s best if you&#8217;ve at least read one of these other games.
