_Be The Media_ is a free one-page game about playing scrappy documentary filmmakers trying to right wrongs in their communities by exposing truth, giving voice to the voiceless, and speaking truth to power.

It's based on the _Apocalypse World_ system by Vincent and Meguey Baker, though it's more directly based on _World of Dungeons: Turbo Breakers_ by John Harper.
