Thoughts on the Live Journal interactive narrative idea:

1. I don&#8217;t want to do &#8220;the story game&#8221; (where each person writes a piece of the story).

2. I don&#8217;t want to do a simple novel serialization like [Class of 91][1] or a &#8220;writing in public&#8221; exercise like [Listener][2] by Ellis or [Unwirer][3] by Cory Doctorow and Charlie Stross. But, I wouldn&#8217;t rule out the idea of doing a project using Movable Type, a wiki, or some other [collaboration ware][4]. (Brenden, you game?)

3. I&#8217;m thinking of trying to work with non-fiction (to be true to the journaling purpose of the community). But I don&#8217;t want to duplicate [the Fray][5] or [City Stories][6] and the like.

4. I want to find some way to integrate filters, social network features, commenting and so on.

5. Perhaps a sort of non-fiction role-playing game? Or a game with &#8220;assignments&#8221; to be carried out in real life, and then reported on in the journal?
