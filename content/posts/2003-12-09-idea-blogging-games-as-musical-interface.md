I&#8217;m gonna do some idea-blogging over the next few days, trying to get some ideas out there for some feedback (or at least so I don&#8217;t forget them).

I&#8217;ve had this &#8220;games as musical interface&#8221; idea for a couple years. A number of &#8220;generative&#8221; and &#8220;fractal&#8221; music programs out there (check out [this listing][1]). Mostly the interfaces consist of typing in numbers, moving sliders around, or dragging something around the screen randomly. These don&#8217;t seem like engaging interfaces.

The idea of using games for an interface isn&#8217;t new: [this guy has a 3D fractal music game][2]: however, I&#8217;ve never been able to get it to run on my computer, and now I can&#8217;t even find the download on his web site. My idea is to use a series of constantly changing classic games clones &#8211; Pacman, Space Invaders, Tetris, etc. The position of different game objects act as the random data for a music and graphics generator, making it easy for almost anyone to create music and visual compositions; even if they&#8217;re not good with music or at playing games. It also creates a game in which the goal is not to &#8220;win&#8221; but to create interesting music. This could also work as a multi-player game, with the data being split between the two players.

One important aspect is that the &#8220;voices&#8221; should be configurable. Output to MIDI, or to a set of samples (a la MOD tracking programs) .

A bit of a head-trip feature I&#8217;d like to see in the game: the games constantly morph into each other. One minute you&#8217;re playing Tetris, moving a block around, and then suddenly the blocks you&#8217;ve stack start to look like a maze and your block is pac-man. Then ghosts show up and eventually the whole game is Pac-Man. You play this for a while, then it starts to turn into Space Invaders. Which then turns into Astroids. The changes are random, Tetris sometimes turns into Astroids or Space Invaders instead of Pac-Man.

Jeremy Winters doesn&#8217;t think Max/MSP is powerful enough to create something like this. I would like to see it done in Flash, but I kind of doubt that&#8217;s possible either.
